# Task Management Application

## Project Description

This Task Management Application is designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks through a user-friendly interface. The frontend is built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS, while the backend uses Node.js and MongoDB. The application handles API requests and uses Next.js for server-side rendering. The codebase is thoroughly documented to aid understanding and ease of setup.
